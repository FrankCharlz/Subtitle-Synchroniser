Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'll be right back.

DAVID: So funny.
"Injunctive relief."

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,753
That tickled my funny bone.

00:01:37,504 --> 00:01:39,224
What's up, Nick? (SIGHS)

13
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:41,666
Fucking sucks dick
about Grandma, huh?

14
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,796
Yeah.

15
00:01:44,798 --> 00:01:46,932
Old woman fucking
murdered like that.

16
00:01:46,934 --> 00:01:48,700
Nick, she had cancer.

17
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:50,669
That's what they
want you to think.

18
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:53,305
She had cancer for 10 years.

19
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:55,874
A little too convenient, Jason.

20
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:58,744
No, it's not, at all.

21
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:00,512
We'll never know the truth.

22
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:02,314
We absolutely know the truth.
Yeah.

23
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:04,216
Grandma had cancer
for 10 years.

24
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:06,285
You don't just die
from cancer, Jason!

25
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:07,920
It's a conspiracy, man.

26
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:10,656
Just like 9/11.

27
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,226
Oh, God.

28
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:16,228
For your information,
Grandma is not right here.

29
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,931
Grandma is gone and she
was taken from us.

30
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,732
And we must find the man that did this.
Nick! Nick!

31
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,534
Stop it. Ow, man!

32
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:24,369
There are Rockport's.

I'll see you at the

What are you doing? Are you kidding me?
Right now?

37
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,378
Hey, get your shit together!

38
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,947
My dad and my fiancee

Beyonce's here? No.

Your dad and fiancee are
saying yes to Beyonce?

42
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,353
What? No.

43
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:42,754
Is Jay-Z here, too? No, Nick.

00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,723
Is Blue Ivy here? Nick. (SIGHS)

What are you doing? I'm just...

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,632
Are you fucking high right now?

50
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,367
No, this isn't...

51
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:57,236
You're high as a kite!
It's an e-cigarette.

52
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:58,837
It's filled with a little weed,
but it's an e-cigarette.

53
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:00,606
Grow up, man!
What are you doing?

54
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:03,609
"Grow up"? How adult are you?

55
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,978
What, do you listen
to NPR in your Volvo?

56
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,879
You play racquetball
competitively

57
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,748
against business associates?
No. No.

58
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,950
You ever go away to a rented
house with other couples

59
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,685
and then play <i>Scattergories
</i> over a bottle of white wine?

00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:14,808

I'm not hugging you.

67
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,156

stop messing around?

You're high now.
You're high now.

Coral or salmon?

Well, what do you like?

93
00:05:17,644 --> 00:05:19,478
I mean... I like the coral.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,520
That's what
I was going to say, too.

00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,636
Okay, cool. Okay. Okay.

Anyway, I'm down
in Valdosta right now.

101
00:05:41,535 --> 00:05:43,101
I opened up
a fucking pet shop...

102
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:44,536
Not pet shop, "puppy mill."

103
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,138
Puppy mill...

104
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,807
You know, designer dogs
get a bad name,

105
00:05:48,809 --> 00:05:50,776
but they can go
for quite a pretty penny.

106
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:52,811
Really? It's just hard
to get them to mate.

107
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:54,613
Oh. Because the little dogs,

108
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,681
they don't wanna
fuck the big dogs,

109
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,750
and the big dogs, they don't
wanna fuck the little dogs...

110
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:01,520
So I got to manually
do it, you know. Oh.

111
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:04,022
I got to spread
and manually shoot in.

112
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:05,924
Uh-huh. So, what's up with you?

113
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:07,492
Well, I'm keeping
pretty busy...

114
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:09,528
Cool. Hey, Aunt Diane,

115
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,762
how's it going? Hi, Nick.

116
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,197
Hey, Nick.

117
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,032
I just don't understand
why you have to drive

118
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:15,634
down to Florida,
tomorrow already, Dad!

119
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:17,068
We just had the funeral.

120
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,969
Your grandmother
and I were there

121
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,438
at this time every year.

122
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,806
It's what
she would have wanted.

123
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,474
I'd drive down myself,

124
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:24,476
except they took
my license away.

125
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:26,711
But why does Jason have
to be the one to drive you?

126
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:28,079
He's so busy at work...

127
00:06:28,081 --> 00:06:29,548
Got the wedding
coming up next weekend,

128
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,882
the rehearsal brunch.

129
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:33,485
You know, the entire law
firm is coming to this.

130
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:35,554
It's true, Grandpa. Jason...

131
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:37,796
We have a lot of stuff, Meredith and I...
I'll handle it.

132
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,691
JASON: Go ahead.

133
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:42,494
How about Cousin Nick?
Huh, Dad?

134
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,529
Why doesn't Nick do it?

135
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,097
We got this chocolate Lab
down at the store

136
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,899
that is just so horny,

137
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,668
every time I touch
the back of its ear,

138
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,770
it just gushes cum.

139
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:53,839
Uh, okay. I mean,
like a squirting...

140
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,841
Is that your dog?

141
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,175
Nick isn't legally allowed

142
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,944
to leave the state
of Georgia anymore.

143
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:01,246
I've barely seen this guy
since high school.

144
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,114
What's wrong with spending
some time with him?

145
00:07:03,116 --> 00:07:04,683
Oh, so spending time
with family

146
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,751
is suddenly important
to you now?

147
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,687
Look, he can come here tomorrow
morning for breakfast.

148
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,255
We can drive down
to Boca during the day,

149
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:12,624
maybe play a round
of golf or two,

150
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,593
then he'd be back here
in Atlanta the next day.

151
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:16,928
He can't just
flake off for two days!

152
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,730
The risk versus reward
here is just...

153
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,799
I don't see it happening.

154
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,161
(SIGHS) It's what she would
have wanted, that's all.

155
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:27,572
But if you have to get
ready for your wedding,

156
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:29,040
if you're that busy...

157
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,985
I just don't understand
why he wants you to take him.

158
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:41,653
You're not even that close.

159
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,722
Well, we used to be.

160
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:44,890
Grandpa and I got along
growing up.

161
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:46,925
We used to build these

162
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,894
model trains every Christmas,
so I brought him...

163
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:49,961
Well, it seems like
we're cutting it

164
00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:51,696
a little close here, you know,

165
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:52,764
with the rehearsal
brunch on Friday...

166
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,633
I know. I know.

167
00:07:54,635 --> 00:07:56,601
And by the way,
I can't find any

168
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,603
of the Martha's Vineyard
vacation photos

169
00:07:58,605 --> 00:07:59,804
for the slide show. (SIGHS)

170
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:01,139
I'm just freaking out.

171
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:02,674
That's because
they're on my laptop,

172
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:04,075
which I've got right here.

173
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:05,243
So I'll send them
to the wedding planner.

174
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:07,045
You don't have to worry
about anything.

175
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:10,582
Thanks. Oh, and your dad says take

Yeah, I know. He's got
it all mapped out for me.

177
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,719
And can you take
my car, sweetie?

178

Uh, I need

I'm really sorry, Grandpa.

193

(STAMMERING) I didn't think
you'd be doing that.

194

Ah, so you caught me
taking a number three.

00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,833
Big deal, right? Number three?

sure you're okay?

00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:58,256
Thanks for doing this,
by the way.

to have breakfast here?

That's your breakfast.

Now let's go get in that

with this, Grandpa?

Don't worry, if you spill it,

221

That's right,
and Meredith is too.

00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,089
You know, her dad is one of

there, so...

I know, that's... Yeah.

229

It couldn't have
worked out better.

230
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,296
Because it's just
that I remember

231
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:13,031
when you were in high school,

232
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,799
you told me how much you
wanted to be a photographer,

233
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,035
travel the world.
That sort of thing.

234
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,236
You remember when
I got you that subscription

235
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:20,405
to <i>Time</i> magazine?

236
00:11:20,407 --> 00:11:23,742
Yeah, I used to be into
photography, but, um...

237
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,910
I mean, with Dad being
at the firm, pfft,

238
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:27,445
it just made so much more sense

239
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,247
to focus on
a college curriculum

240
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:30,949
that stressed
the law school track.

241
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,417
I mean, I love what I do,
Grandpa.

is awesome,

SEC compliance...

shit in my mouth

What's the trifecta again?

274
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:42,187
It's this thing I read about

where in my senior year
I have to fuck a freshman,

276

277
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:47,826
Where did you read that?
In my diary.

Hmm.

279

beautiful portraits

or Photoshop...

gonna go say hi to him. Okay?

Jamba! (EXCLAIMS) What the fuck!

00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:12,248
Pam! Pam! FINCH: My God.
He is just a good one.

1046
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,951
He is the number one...
Lover and a fighter...

1047
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:16,085
Okay, listen.

1048
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:21,057
Guys, I really respect
the job you guys do.

1049
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,892
I'm being completely honest
from the bottom of my heart,

1050
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:26,396
I look up to you.
I fight for the law.

1051
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:27,864
Thank you. No one ever
says that to us. Ever.

1052
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:29,746
That's what I wanted to do
when I was a kid.

1053
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:32,135
I wanna do what you guys do.

1054
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:36,105
Mostly people just call us pigs and
throw bags of fast food at us.

1055
00:43:36,107 --> 00:43:39,175
I'm incredibly sorry for all this
confusion, but listen to me,

1056
00:43:39,177 --> 00:43:42,178
please, I have to
let you know I'm a lawyer.

1057
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,781
Whoa, whoa! You're a lawyer?
Wait a second.

1058
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:46,282
Yeah, I'm actually a lawyer.

1059
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:48,985
Whoa. You don't look
like a lawyer. No.

1060
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:51,107
Yeah, I handle, like,
uh, corporate stuff.

1061
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:55,458
Like, uh, like LLC agreements.

1062
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,927
LP... You lost me. I don't
even know what that means.

1063
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:01,264
I mean, you don't look Jewish.
No.

1064
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:03,099
(SIGHS) If you think about it,
it's actually pretty funny.

1065
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,967
(LAUGHING)

1066
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:06,402
Like, ending up here
on this side...

1067
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:08,764
It is. That is funny.
It is so weird.

1068
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:11,708
It's darkly ironic.
It really is.

1069
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:14,210
Yes, exactly. Dark irony.

1070
00:44:14,212 --> 00:44:17,313
I thought you had to be, like,
at least 80 to be a lawyer.

1071
00:44:17,315 --> 00:44:19,015
(SCOFFS) Lawyer. Like, it's
a lot of school, right?

1072
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:20,316
Yeah.

1073
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:22,185
(STAMMERS)
It's a lot of school.

1074
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:24,721
The bar...

1075
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:27,023
It's something I took
and passed.

1076
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:28,758
It's not something
I stand behind.

1077
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,460
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

1078
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,295
I'm not on this side,
typically,

1079
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:34,063
and I just, uh... I just...

1080
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:37,800
I know my rights and
I would love my phone call.

1081
00:44:37,802 --> 00:44:39,335
Objection. Overruled.

1082
00:44:39,337 --> 00:44:41,804
Permission to approach the bench.
Denied!

1083
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:43,372
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) What?

1084
00:44:43,374 --> 00:44:45,414
It's easy to be a lawyer.
It's so easy.

1085
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:47,477
(STAMMERING)
I would love my phone call.

1086
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:48,511
(BOTH MOCKING)

1087
00:44:49,047 --> 00:44:50,480
Okay?

1088
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:52,248
I know my rights.
I want my phone call.

1089
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,050
(BOTH CONTINUE MOCKING)
Give me my phone call.

1090
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:55,351
I should have a phone...

1091
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:57,370
This is my
First Amendment right.

1092
00:44:57,371 --> 00:44:59,388
It is my first... First and foremost...
Page one, number one...

1093
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,923
amendment says that
I get my telephone.

1094
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:02,391
And most of all,
can I get a phone call?

1095
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:04,393
This is my
First Amendment right.

1096
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:05,428
(MOCKINGLY) I don't think you understand
that I'm guaranteed a phone call.

1097
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:08,264
I don't sound like that.

1098
00:45:08,266 --> 00:45:10,366
(MOCKINGLY) Yeah?
What do you sound like then?

1099
00:45:10,368 --> 00:45:11,367
Um, not like that. I don't
think I sound like that.

1100
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:13,035
(BOTH CONTINUE MOCKING)

1101
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:16,789
Give me my phone call.

1102
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:19,407
Oh, please, will you let me have
my phone call? ...phone call.

1103
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,911
I'm an American and
I'm fucking guaranteed...

1104
00:45:21,913 --> 00:45:23,546
I'm an American.

1105
00:45:23,548 --> 00:45:25,548
I am guaranteed a phone call.

1106
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:29,110
(MOCKINGLY) Legally, it's my
right to have a phone call.

1107
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:32,054
I just said I'm an American

1108
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:33,990
and I'm guaranteed
a phone call.

1109
00:45:33,992 --> 00:45:36,225
Hmm. Well, now
he's getting demanding.

1110
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:37,994
Yeah. We better give
him his phone call.

1111
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:39,128
(MOCKINGLY) Better
give him his phone call.

1112
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,963
Guys, come on. Come on, please.

1113
00:45:40,965 --> 00:45:43,132
It doesn't...
Why are we doing this?

1114
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:44,901
This is your phone
right here, right?

1115
00:45:44,903 --> 00:45:47,003
That is my phone. Yes.

1116
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,805
Well, you know what?

1117
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:51,073
We get to make one phone
call on your phone.

1118
00:45:51,075 --> 00:45:52,942
That's where you're just
a little bit mixed up.

1119
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:54,844
Yeah. Hopefully, you're not
out of "framily" minutes.

1120
00:45:54,846 --> 00:45:56,979
No, no, no, no, no... Yeah, we
get a free Uber ride on that.

1121
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,548
Go ahead. Take us out to lunch.

1122
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,416
Hey, you know what? We're gonna
be kind and set you up with

1123
00:46:00,418 --> 00:46:02,118
a Tinder account too.

1124
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,219
OFFICER REITER: Ooh, how about Grindr.
What about...

1125
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,319
OFFICER FINCH: Look at
this, look at this.

1126
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,419
"Jefe", is that how
you pronounce that?

1127
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:06,923
Yeah, how about Jefe?

1128
00:46:06,925 --> 00:46:09,325
Yeah. Huh? Little
alone time with Jefe?

1129
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:12,195
He'd like some light conversation
and heavy petting, flirting...

1130
00:46:12,197 --> 00:46:13,896
Flirtations.

1131
00:46:13,898 --> 00:46:15,681
OFFICER REITER: Hmm.
He looks thick and lonely.

1132
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:17,465
OFFICER FINCH: You'll meet him at 8:00.
You'll bring wine coolers.

1133
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:19,001
And...

1134
00:46:20,505 --> 00:46:22,465
Children's condoms. (LAUGHS)

1135
00:46:24,008 --> 00:46:25,241
Just gonna take a little picture.
Oh.

1136
00:46:25,243 --> 00:46:26,909
Snatch-chat.
Yeah, a little snach-chat.

1137
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,177
Please don't do that
with my phone.

1138
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:29,478
Hope you got a wide
angle lens on that.

1139
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,200
Oh! Wow. (PHONE RINGING)

1140
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,416
(CHUCKLES)

1141
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:34,418
Kidding.

1142
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:39,889
Somebody just posted his bail.
Get that pervert some pants.

1143
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:42,024
OFFICER FINCH: All right.

1144
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:44,160
These were a couple
pair of pants

1145
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:49,298
from murder victims from
a 1990s orgy gone bad.

1146
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,820
We got semen-stained
or blood-stained.

1147
00:46:52,303 --> 00:46:54,623
Take your pick.
What's it gonna be?

1148
00:46:55,974 --> 00:46:57,974
Blood. Semen it is.

1149
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:02,044
Hey, there he is. No.

1150
00:47:03,648 --> 00:47:05,348
Don't even fucking talk to me.

1151
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,984
Oh. Look, I know things
got a little chaotic,

1152
00:47:07,986 --> 00:47:09,652
but I'm so close with Lenore...

1153
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:11,520
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1154
00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:14,123
I'm about to get fucking
married, Grandpa!

1155
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,025
In one week! To a Jewish girl!

1156
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:18,127
And I just woke up
in fucking jail

1157
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:21,230
with a bunch of penises
on my forehead

1158
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:23,073
in the shape of a swastika!

1159
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:26,582
Could call it a swasticock.

1160
00:47:27,205 --> 00:47:29,238
What? It's a play on words.

1161
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,321
Oh, it's a play on words.

1162
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:32,676
A play on words.

1163
00:47:35,346 --> 00:47:36,913
Play on these words.

1164
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,180
I'm dropping you off

1165
00:47:38,182 --> 00:47:40,683
at your old army vet
buddy's house,

1166
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:42,985
he's gonna drive you
to fucking Boca.

1167
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:44,627
Because I'm fucking
done with you.

1168
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,392
What the fuck
are you looking at?

1169
00:47:49,394 --> 00:47:51,635
I can't help
staring at your tits.

1170
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,696
Pow!

1171
00:47:53,698 --> 00:47:55,418
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1172
00:48:00,004 --> 00:48:02,672
You know, Stinky
had more confirmed kills

1173
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:06,275
than anyone in our platoon
back in 'Nam? 118.

1174
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:07,557
Shut the fuck up.

1175
00:48:09,414 --> 00:48:10,980
What is this place?

1176
00:48:10,982 --> 00:48:12,515
I don't know. Or care.

1177
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:14,050
At least just come in with me.

1178
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:15,492
Let's make sure
it's the right house.

1179
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:16,686
After you.

1180
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:19,270
Grandson of the year.

1181
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,765
Your grandmother's
ashes are in there.

1182
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:27,536
She's in a coffin. Fuck you!

1183
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:32,114
<i>Oh, well,
better late than never.</i>

1184
00:48:32,971 --> 00:48:34,637
Yeah! Fuck them up, ALF!

1185
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:36,813
Motherfucker!

1186
00:48:37,742 --> 00:48:40,109
Stinky?

1187
00:48:40,111 --> 00:48:42,312
What the fuck are you
doing here, Dick?

1188
00:48:43,014 --> 00:48:44,246
Oh, this?

1189
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,983
Nah, this is liver failure.

1190
00:48:50,421 --> 00:48:52,188
Who's the lesbian?

1191
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,230
That's my grandson, Jason.

1192
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:55,591
Yeah?

1193
00:48:55,593 --> 00:48:58,094
Is he here to scissor with me?

1194
00:48:58,096 --> 00:48:59,695
Okay, that's just
offensive to lesbians.

1195
00:48:59,697 --> 00:49:02,131
I am very sorry, k.d. lang.

1196
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:05,568
Time for Bingo!

1197
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,370
Come on. Stinky, we got to get
you the fuck out of here.

1198
00:49:07,372 --> 00:49:09,005
Come on, let's go.

1199
00:49:09,007 --> 00:49:12,408
Uh, I got one fucking
month left, Dick!

1200
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,511
I don't want you to
remember me like this, man.

1201
00:49:15,513 --> 00:49:17,480
I want you to remember
me as a warrior.

1202
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:20,149
Please. Leave me be.
But, Stinky...

1203
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:22,271
No, no, no...
Just let me finish, Dick.

1204
00:49:23,187 --> 00:49:26,389
Leave me your beautiful
lesbian grandson

1205
00:49:26,391 --> 00:49:28,592
so he can blowjob me to death.

1206
00:49:32,063 --> 00:49:34,383
It's all over for me, Dick.

1207
00:49:35,066 --> 00:49:38,401
You know, all I wanna
do is play Bingo.

1208
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,570
Go.

1209
00:49:42,673 --> 00:49:43,953
NURSE: All ready?

1210
00:49:47,512 --> 00:49:49,645
Bingo! (LAUGHING)

1211
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:58,781
I'm sorry about

01:12:16,393 --> 01:12:20,395
<i>♪ You were my strength
when I was weak</i>

1728
01:12:20,397 --> 01:12:23,898
<i>♪ You were my voice
when I couldn't speak</i>

1729
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,969
<i>♪ You were my eyes
when I couldn't see</i>

1730
01:12:27,971 --> 01:12:31,472
<i>♪ You saw the best
there was in me</i>

1731
01:12:31,474 --> 01:12:35,510
<i>♪ Lifted me up

1732

1734
01:12:45,648 --> 01:12:46,888
Damn!

1735
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,791
<i>♪ Because you loved me ♪</i>

1736
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:55,731
(EXHALES)

1737
01:12:58,601 --> 01:12:59,700
Who are you?

1738
01:13:02,939 --> 01:13:05,973
SHADIA: I'm just saying,
who sings that well

1739
01:13:05,975 --> 01:13:07,809
and isn't
a professional singer?

1740
01:13:07,811 --> 01:13:10,478
You're so good at singing
you actually suck!

1741
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,013
You guys want to come up
for a nightcap?

1742
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:13,214
Yeah, well...

1743
01:13:13,216 --> 01:13:15,883
See if shit gets real?

1744
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,555
Well, uh, young
Michael Buble and I

1745
01:13:20,557 --> 01:13:22,838
are gonna have a stogie
by the pool, so...

1746
01:13:22,926 --> 01:13:24,007
Okay.

1747
01:13:25,228 --> 01:13:26,589
See you up there? Yeah.

1748
01:13:32,556 --> 01:13:35,036
I want you to know
how much I appreciate

1749
01:13:35,038 --> 01:13:37,438
you doing this for me, Jason.

1750
01:13:38,028 --> 01:13:40,508
The greatest gift a grandson
can give his grandfather

1751
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:41,976
is a hot college girl who

1752
01:13:41,978 --> 01:13:44,378
wants to have unprotected sex
with him before he dies.

1753
01:13:45,748 --> 01:13:48,883
Yeah, well, most grandpas
just want toffee.

1754
01:13:51,654 --> 01:13:53,187
(SIGHS)

1755
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:54,469
What's the matter?

1756
01:13:56,759 --> 01:13:58,399
I think I'm gonna
call off my wedding.

1757
01:14:01,764 --> 01:14:06,000
Well, when you get married,
it's for a long fucking time.

1758
01:14:06,002 --> 01:14:07,282
And it's hard.

1759
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:10,271
So it damn well
better be with a woman

1760
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:12,514
who keeps things interesting.

1761
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:14,175
You know your grandmother,

1762
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:16,418
she tried to grow
her own pot plant once?

1763
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,046
Really? Yeah,

1764
01:14:19,048 --> 01:14:20,248
she just wanted to see
if she could do it.

1765
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:23,050
(LAUGHS)

1766
01:14:23,052 --> 01:14:26,693
She was always
surprising me like that.

1767
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:30,424
We also tried anal
once every five years.

1768
01:14:32,161 --> 01:14:33,161
Sweet.

1769
01:14:35,665 --> 01:14:38,105
I miss having someone
to share everything with.

1770
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:42,303
It's not fair
to just keep Shadia

1771
01:14:42,305 --> 01:14:43,538
in the dark like this.

1772
01:14:45,108 --> 01:14:48,109
Since we started this,
it's just been one big lie.

1773
01:14:48,111 --> 01:14:49,192
She has no idea who I am.

1774
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:52,487
I have to tell her the truth.

1775
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,684
Uh, well, maybe telling her
tonight is a little abrupt.

1776
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,121
The most important part
of a relationship is trust.

1777
01:15:00,123 --> 01:15:02,123
That's right.

1778
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,759
And I'm going to start now.

1779
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:07,328
Or you can just wait till I
have sex with Lenore tonight,

1780
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,850
then you can tell
Shadia everything.

1781
01:15:09,899 --> 01:15:11,832
No. I'm just lying.

1782
01:15:11,834 --> 01:15:14,735
Jason, I'm your grandfather!

1783
01:15:14,737 --> 01:15:16,137
You wait till I fuck
that college girl!

1784
01:15:16,139 --> 01:15:18,139
I'm telling her now. Jason...

1785
01:15:18,308 --> 01:15:20,074
Jason! Jason!

1786
01:15:20,076 --> 01:15:21,309
Jason!

1787
01:15:21,311 --> 01:15:22,511
Jason!

1788
01:15:24,914 --> 01:15:25,980
(LAUGHS)

1789
01:15:25,982 --> 01:15:26,982
'Sup, brah?

1790
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:31,686
Back off, D cups!

1791
01:15:31,688 --> 01:15:34,755
Well, if it isn't
the "Professor."

1792
01:15:34,757 --> 01:15:36,958
You know, it's amazing
what you can find

1793
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,359
with a name and
Google these days.

1794
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:40,628
You're not a real professor?

1795
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:42,997
Oh, my God! You lied to us.
How could you.

1796
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:44,966
Wait, wait, wait,
this is the best part.

1797
01:15:44,968 --> 01:15:46,248
This is the best part.

1798
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:50,371
Richard "Dick" Kelly,
Lieutenant Colonel

1799
01:15:50,373 --> 01:15:51,653
in the United States Army,

1800
01:15:53,309 --> 01:15:57,044
also known as the American
Gladiator "Nitro."

1801
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:58,879
What the fuck did you Google?

1802
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:01,716
Okay, well, there's
another best part then.

1803
01:16:03,753 --> 01:16:08,322
"Jason Patrick Kelly will wed
Meredith Miriam Goldstein"

1804
01:16:08,324 --> 01:16:12,059
"at Jericho Temple
on Saturday, March 27th."

1805
01:16:12,061 --> 01:16:16,330
Oh, wait, that's,
um, next Saturday.

1806
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:19,967
Wait, you're grandfather
and grandson?

1807
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:22,169
Oh, my God!
That is so fucked up.

1808
01:16:22,171 --> 01:16:24,571
That is so hot. I mean,
that is so fucked up.

1809
01:16:27,777 --> 01:16:28,943
So...

1810
01:16:31,214 --> 01:16:32,815
Are you getting married
next weekend?

1811
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,770
I was. I was getting married,

1812
01:16:35,779 --> 01:16:38,219
but then I met you,
and now I don't...

1813
01:16:38,221 --> 01:16:39,822
Oh, my God!
No. Don't pull that shit.

1814
01:16:42,392 --> 01:16:44,759
(VOICE BREAKING) I feel fucking
stupid enough as it is.

1815
01:16:49,098 --> 01:16:51,699
So you're not a professor?
Are you even a photographer?

1816
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:52,967
I'm a lawyer.

1817
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:54,201
(LAUGHS)

1818
01:16:55,672 --> 01:16:57,873
I handle SEC compliance.

1819
01:16:59,308 --> 01:17:00,741
LLC agreements.

1820
01:17:00,743 --> 01:17:01,976
I came up here to...

1821
01:17:01,978 --> 01:17:03,978
Get the fuck out, Jason.
Seriously.

1822
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:04,445
Can I have a second to explain?

1823
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:06,180
No!

1824
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:08,149
Hold up, hold up.
Not so fast, "Professor."

1825
01:17:10,787 --> 01:17:12,887
For what's it worth,

1826
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:14,455
I still really
want to fuck you.

1827
01:17:14,457 --> 01:17:16,691
And we're going to fuck.
Yeah, we are.

1828
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:17,858
We're going to thunder fuck.

1829
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,421
You're gonna
tsunami on my face!

1830
01:17:20,129 --> 01:17:22,163
You're gonna
flood like the Nile.

1831
01:17:22,165 --> 01:17:24,699
Yeah. I guess the drought
in my pussy is finally over.

1832
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:26,434
The villagers will finally eat.

1833
01:17:26,436 --> 01:17:27,968
You're gonna die
while you're eating me out.

1834
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,771
I want your last breath
to be in my pussy.

1835
01:17:29,772 --> 01:17:31,038
Lenore! You're such a slut.

1836
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,740
BOTH: Police! Shit!

1837
01:17:32,742 --> 01:17:34,742
That's right.
Po-po in the ho-ho.

1838
01:17:34,744 --> 01:17:36,310
OFFICER REITER:
Some kind of ganja party?

1839
01:17:36,312 --> 01:17:37,945
Sorry to harsh your mellows.

1840
01:17:37,947 --> 01:17:39,747
OFFICER FINCH:
Where's my e-vite?

1841
01:17:39,749 --> 01:17:41,082
Is that the jacket? Check the
right coat pocket. Check it, man.

1842
01:17:41,084 --> 01:17:42,349
Okay, turn around. Come on.

1843
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:43,984
That's my jacket.
That's not his jacket.

1844
01:17:43,986 --> 01:17:45,419
OFFICER FINCH: Up against
the palm. There you go.

1845
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,853
Let's have a look.
What've you got in here? Huh?

1846
01:17:46,856 --> 01:17:48,856
Bingo-bango. OMG.

1847
01:17:48,858 --> 01:17:50,091
What the fuck? That's not mine!

1848
01:17:50,093 --> 01:17:52,860
"What the fuck?"
That's not mine!

1849
01:17:52,862 --> 01:17:54,295
The fuck? Well, it looks
like Spring Break

1850
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:56,397
is finally drug free!

1851
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:57,765
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, pretty boy.

1852
01:17:57,767 --> 01:17:59,500
Oh, shall we?

1853
01:17:59,502 --> 01:18:01,736
No, it doesn't go down
that way. Let's go.

1854
01:18:01,738 --> 01:18:03,170
I'll wait for you, Grandpa.

1855
01:18:03,172 --> 01:18:04,905
DICK: Keep that shit
tight for me!

1856
01:18:04,907 --> 01:18:06,187
He's my Henry Miller.

1857
01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:08,909
What the fuck does that mean?

1858
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:10,144
Exactly!

1859
01:18:10,146 --> 01:18:11,812
(DOOR BUZZING)

1860
01:18:13,116 --> 01:18:15,516
Hey, there he is.

1861
01:18:15,518 --> 01:18:17,485
You got blood on your
pants, you know.

1862
01:18:17,487 --> 01:18:19,487
Your license isn't
even suspended, is it?

1863
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:21,322
You made all this up just so
I'd come down here with you.

1864
01:18:21,324 --> 01:18:23,444
I had to make sure you'd come.

1865
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,392
Fuck you!

1866
01:18:25,394 --> 01:18:27,394
Just chill, Jason.
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

1867
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:32,166
JASON: Who the fuck are you?

1868
01:18:32,168 --> 01:18:33,801
I should have known
you were fucking crazy

1869
01:18:33,803 --> 01:18:35,236
the moment you started
hitting on women

1870
01:18:35,238 --> 01:18:37,171
the day after
Grandma's funeral!

1871
01:18:37,173 --> 01:18:39,073
Don't you fucking judge me.

1872
01:18:39,075 --> 01:18:41,242
You have no idea what I had
with your grandmother.

1873
01:18:41,244 --> 01:18:42,510
And everything I've done
these last few days

1874
01:18:42,512 --> 01:18:44,311
I've done for a reason.

1875
01:18:44,313 --> 01:18:46,480
You were about to fuck up
royally by getting married,

1876
01:18:46,482 --> 01:18:48,115
and you fucking know it!
Oh, yeah?

1877
01:18:48,117 --> 01:18:49,757
What the fuck am I
supposed to do now?

1878
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,320
Chase around some college girl

1879
01:18:53,322 --> 01:18:55,456
that doesn't even want
to fucking talk to me?

1880
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,324
Not know what the fuck I'm
doing for the rest of my life?

1881
01:18:57,326 --> 01:18:58,425
Yeah, because at least
you'd be thinking

1882
01:18:58,427 --> 01:18:59,794
for yourself for a change.

1883
01:18:59,796 --> 01:19:01,195
What the fuck
does that even mean?

1884
01:19:01,197 --> 01:19:03,063
Your father has lorded
over every decision

1885
01:19:03,065 --> 01:19:04,932
you've made in your adult life,

1886
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:07,168
and Meredith is just
the latest example of that!

1887
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,036
She's not right for you, Jason.

1888
01:19:09,038 --> 01:19:10,871
If you marry her, you're
going to be sleepwalking

1889
01:19:10,873 --> 01:19:12,173
through the rest of your life
and be completely unhappy,

1890
01:19:12,175 --> 01:19:13,541
just like your father!

1891
01:19:13,543 --> 01:19:15,543
I am already
unhappy with my life,

1892
01:19:15,545 --> 01:19:19,079
because I've done nothing
but get fucked by you

1893
01:19:19,081 --> 01:19:21,816
and this insane fuck rampage
that you've been on.

1894
01:19:21,818 --> 01:19:23,818
It wasn't a "fuck
rampage" for me.

1895
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,085
It was a "fuck rampage" for you.

1896

a Chipwich or some heroin,

the middle of it right here.

supposed to do?

2081
01:29:00,596 --> 01:29:02,116
Just leave him on the
side of the road?

Hey, man, can you slow down?

2083
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,666
You're making this
very difficult.

01:29:06,668 --> 01:29:08,001
What the fuck!
That was you who drew

2085
01:29:08,003 --> 01:29:09,803
all those dicks
on me last week?

2086
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:11,605

that you were lying to me?

But you have to admit
when we were together

2145
01:31:58,907 --> 01:32:00,173
it felt great.

2146
01:32:00,175 --> 01:32:02,336

I just broke up with my
fiancee, lost my job.

2158
01:32:47,122 --> 01:32:49,602

by the police, so...

you're lesbians!

from your adjacent
municipalities.

2171
01:33:31,066 --> 01:33:32,365

2172
01:33:32,367 --> 01:33:33,900

about the juris-dick-tion
you're in.

over your face, you idiot!

done nothing wrong.

I've got to get out of here.

2189
01:34:04,066 --> 01:34:06,066
I should go, question mark?

take my squad car.
